@version 1.0.1

This program takes in two Allegro Netlists that have been converted to Excel format (copy and paste from .htm)
and parses them to accurately and rapidly find all points at both the net and the pin level where there are 
disagreements between the two netlists. The main purpose of this is to aide in the translation of schematics
from one format (in my case, OrCAD) to another (Cadence HDL). 

To do: 
    -Go straight from htm to Excel upload (aka supporting more file formats)
        -Goal of this is to streamline process - instead of having to copy & paste from htm file, you should just 
        be able to drop in the htm files to the Data subfolder.
    
    -Redesign with classes in mind - limit the amount of information reuse
        -Goal of this is to increase overall code readability and decrease runtime for large input files
    
    -Decide on one format - either Pandas or OpenPyxl
        -Goal of this is to reduce the amount of dependencies and O(N^2) passes through the list.
    
Overall efficiency is O(N^2) but true efficiency is Î¸(12N^2) or higher where N is the amount of rows in the two 
netlists.


Changelist:
Version 1.0.1:
    -Added finishing output statements to show that the program successfully uploaded the new sheets.
    -Added more detail to what is different in Compared Net Results

Version 1.0:
    -Original commit
